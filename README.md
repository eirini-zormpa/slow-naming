# Slow naming of pictures facilitates memory for their names
This contains the analyses for the behavioural data reported in [Zormpa, Meyer, &amp; Brehm (PBR, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-019-01620-x).
The analyses of the eye-tracking data are not included here.

## Contents
The `script` folder contains three scripts:

1. a simplified script in which the behavioural dataset is created,
2. the analysis script (which also contains the code to create the visualisations presented in the paper) and
3. a helper script which contains the funtion to create half violins. This is copied directly from this [David Robinson gist](https://gist.github.com/dgrtwo/eb7750e74997891d7c20).
